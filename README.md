# Nils Van de Pitte

Software Engineer with a strong focus on **system design, platform architecture, and long-term maintainability**.

I primarily build data-intensive applications where correctness, performance, and clarity are critical. My approach emphasizes thoughtful domain modeling, explicit business logic, and engineering decisions that remain stable as systems evolve.

---

## Areas of Focus

- Backend architecture and domain-driven design
- Scalable application and data modeling
- API design and system integration
- Performance, concurrency, and data integrity
- Developer experience and maintainable codebases

I value pragmatic engineering and prefer simple, explicit solutions over unnecessary abstraction.

## Engineering Principles

- Domain-Driven Design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Transactional consistency and explicit state transitions
- Test coverage where it provides long-term value
- Readability and correctness over premature optimization

---

## Approach

I typically start by understanding the domain and its constraints, then design systems that accommodate change with minimal friction. My work favors predictability, observability, and well-defined boundaries between components.
