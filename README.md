# 👋 Hey, I'm Nils Van de Pitte

**Full Stack Engineer** focused on building fast, reliable, and scalable systems for startups and small teams.  
I turn messy problems into clean, predictable, automated workflows.

## 🚀 About Me

I build **high-performance platforms** end-to-end: backend architecture, frontend interfaces, data processing engines, and automation pipelines.  
My focus is always the same: clean design, performance first, and systems that can scale without becoming fragile.

Whether it's recruitment workflows, property management integrations, or lead tracking engines, I aim for products that feel robust, structured, and optimized from day one.

## 🧠 What I Build

### 🧩 Humanly  
A recruitment, onboarding, and HR automation platform built to modernize how companies hire.

**Core highlights**
- Built recruiter tools that define a job, configure preferences, and set automation rules  
- Designed an AI-powered ranking system that sorts applicants into dynamic tiers (best matches → lower priority)  
- Created configurable workflows for invites, top picks, auto-processing, and review steps  
- Focused on maintainable logic so recruitment teams can scale without drowning in manual review

Humanly aims to streamline early-stage hiring processes by blending automation, configurability, and clean data pipelines.

### ⚡ CliQ - Client & Lead Tracker  
A freelance lead, client, and revenue management system designed to replace spreadsheets and manual tracking.

**Key features**
- Lead intake + lifecycle tracking (new → contacted → active → closed)  
- Client management with notes, timeline, activity log, and pipeline status  
- Invoice tracking, revenue reports, and simple analytics  
- Automations for reminders and follow-ups  

The goal: a minimal but powerful system that helps freelancers (and eventually agencies) keep a predictable overview of their work.

**Reservation Checker**

## 💡 Philosophy

Scalability starts at design — not after launch.  
I avoid complexity for the sake of complexity, and focus on clear logic, predictable data flow, and performance-first architecture.
